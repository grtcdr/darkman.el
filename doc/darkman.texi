@node Installation
@chapter Installation

This package is available from @uref{https://melpa.org, MELPA} provided you've added that to the
list of @ref{Package Installation,package archives,,emacs,} to fetch from, install it by evaluating:

@lisp
(package-install 'darkman)
@end lisp

For a manual installation, begin by cloning the repository:

@example
git clone --branch 1.0.0 https://github.com/grtcdr/darkman.el darkman
@end example

Next, add the package to your @uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html, load path}:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "darkman")
@end lisp

Finally, require the package like so:

@lisp
(require 'darkman)
@end lisp

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

In your @samp{init.el} file, define which theme is associated with which
mode. By default, @emph{modus-themes} will be used, but we'll choose the
@emph{tango} variants in this example.

@lisp
(setq darkman-themes '(:light tango :dark tango-dark))
@end lisp

You can also use @samp{M-x customize-group darkman RET} to customize the
variable.

@samp{darkman.el} can listen for any signals to change the theme without
requiring you to manually create any scripts. You can enable this
behavior by enabling the minor mode:

@lisp
(darkman-mode)
@end lisp

You should not call @samp{load-theme} in your configuration as
@samp{darkman-mode} when enabled will do that for you, even on startup.

@menu
* Other functions::
@end menu

@node Other functions
@section Other functions

@samp{M-x darkman-toggle} will toggle the mode of the Darkman service from
within Emacs.

Additionally, you can use the @samp{darkman-get} and @samp{darkman-set}
functions to manually get and set the mode of the service
respectively.

@node Working alongside the built-in safety features
@section Working alongside the built-in safety features

@samp{load-theme} is part of the @samp{custom.el} library and it comes with
certain @uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html, security features} that you may regard as inconvenient, but
they're absolutely necessary to preserve the security of your
system. We have decided to work hand in hand with these pre-existing
safety mechanisms in favor of implementing our own.

Problems may arise @footnote{This is @uref{https://github.com/grtcdr/darkman.el/pull/7#issuecomment-1422666665, known to happen} in Doom Emacs.} if this package is loaded in a @ref{Emacs Server,server setting,,emacs,} and
too early during the initialization phase, i.e. before @samp{custom-file},
you can prevent this from happening by activating the mode @strong{only} when
the session has been fully initialized:

@lisp
(when (daemonp)
  (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook #'darkman-mode)
  (advice-add 'darkman-mode
              :after
              (lambda ()
                (remove-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook
                             #'darkman-mode))))
@end lisp

@node Disabling existing themes
@section Disabling existing themes

Emacs does not by default disable the current theme when another one
is loaded, and while this behavior might seem unintuitive, we can
always advise @samp{darkman-set} (and by extension @samp{darkman-toggle}), or
even @samp{load-theme} if you prefer, to disable any existing themes first.

@lisp
(defadvice darkman-set (before no-theme-stacking activate)
  "Disable the previous theme before loading a new one."
  (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes))
@end lisp

@end menu

@node Is D-Bus running?
@section Is D-Bus running?

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here's an example using @samp{systemd}:

@example
systemctl status dbus
@end example

@example
dbus.service - D-Bus System Message Bus
   Loaded: loaded
   Active: active (running)
@end example

@node Is Darkman running?
@section Is Darkman running?

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here's an example using @samp{systemd}:

@example
systemctl status --user darkman
@end example

@example
darkman.service - Framework for dark-mode and light-mode transitions.
   Loaded: loaded
   Active: active (running)
@end example

@node Is Emacs built with D-Bus support?
@section Is Emacs built with D-Bus support?

Usually it is, unless you're building from source, in which case you
can verify whether or not Emacs was built with D-Bus support using
@samp{C-h v system-configuration-features RET} which should list @samp{DBUS}.
