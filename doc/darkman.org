* Installation

#+include: "../README.org::*Installation" :only-contents t

* Usage

In your =init.el= file, define which theme is associated with which
mode. By default, /modus-themes/ will be used, but we'll choose the
/tango/ variants in this example.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq darkman-themes '(:light tango :dark tango-dark))
#+end_src

You can also use =M-x customize-group darkman RET= to customize the
variable.

=darkman.el= can listen for any signals to change the theme without
requiring you to manually create any scripts. You can enable this
behavior by enabling the minor mode:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(darkman-mode)
#+end_src

You should not call =load-theme= in your configuration as
=darkman-mode= when enabled will do that for you, even on startup.

** Other functions

=M-x darkman-toggle= will toggle the mode of the Darkman service from
within Emacs.

Additionally, you can use the =darkman-get= and =darkman-set=
functions to manually get and set the mode of the service
respectively.

* Tips

** Working alongside the built-in safety features

=load-theme= is part of the =custom.el= library and it comes with
certain [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html][security features]] that you may regard as inconvenient, but
they're absolutely necessary to preserve the security of your
system. We have decided to work hand in hand with these pre-existing
safety mechanisms in favor of implementing our own.

Problems may arise [fn:1] if this package is loaded in a [[info:emacs#Emacs Server][server setting]] and
too early during the initialization phase, i.e. before =custom-file=,
you can prevent this from happening by activating the mode *only* when
the session has been fully initialized:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (daemonp)
  (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook #'darkman-mode)
  (advice-add 'darkman-mode
	      :after
              (lambda ()
                (remove-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook
			     #'darkman-mode))))
#+end_src

** Disabling existing themes

Emacs does not by default disable the current theme when another one
is loaded, and while this behavior might seem unintuitive, we can
always advise =darkman-set= (and by extension =darkman-toggle=), or
even =load-theme= if you prefer, to disable any existing themes first.

#+begin_src elisp
(defadvice darkman-set (before no-theme-stacking activate)
  "Disable the previous theme before loading a new one."
  (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes))
#+end_src

* Debugging

** Is D-Bus running?

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here's an example using =systemd=:

#+begin_src sh
systemctl status dbus
#+end_src

#+begin_example
dbus.service - D-Bus System Message Bus
   Loaded: loaded
   Active: active (running)
#+end_example

** Is Darkman running?

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here's an example using =systemd=:

#+begin_src sh
systemctl status --user darkman
#+end_src

#+begin_example
darkman.service - Framework for dark-mode and light-mode transitions.
   Loaded: loaded
   Active: active (running)
#+end_example

** Is Emacs built with D-Bus support?

Usually it is, unless you're building from source, in which case you
can verify whether or not Emacs was built with D-Bus support using
=C-h v system-configuration-features RET= which should list =DBUS=.
