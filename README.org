#+title: darkman.el

This package provides seamless integration between [[https://darkman.whynothugo.nl][Darkman]] and [[https://gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]]
using the [[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/][D-Bus]] protocol.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

In an effort to keep the instructions concise, portable and applicable
no matter the situation, this section will not list every possible
method through which you can install the package, only the most basic.

With that in mind, begin by cloning the repository:

#+begin_src sh
git clone --branch 0.3.0 https://github.com/grtcdr/darkman.el darkman
#+end_src

Next, add the package to your =load-path=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "darkman")
#+end_src

Finally, require the package like so:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'darkman)
#+end_src

* Usage

** Automatically set the theme on startup

In your =init.el= file, define which theme is associated with which
mode, by default =modus-themes= are used, but we'll use the =tango=
variants in this example.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq darkman-themes '(:light tango :dark tango-dark))
#+end_src

You could also use =M-x customize-group darkman RET= to customize the
variable.

Instead of manually configuring a theme, you should do it this way:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-theme (darkman-get-theme))
#+end_src

=darkman-get-theme= returns a theme based on the current mode and its
corresponding theme which we previously specified.

=load-theme= will, for [[#safety][safety reasons]], ask you for confirmation if the
theme you're about to load is not included in its hashed form in the
=custom-safe-themes= variable.

** Automatically switch themes when the mode changes

=darkman.el= can listen for any signals to change the theme without
requiring you to manually create any scripts.

You can enable this behavior by enabling the minor mode:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(darkman-mode)
#+end_src

** Other functions

=M-x darkman-toggle= will toggle the mode of the Darkman service from
within Emacs.

Additionally, you can use the =darkman-get= and =darkman-set=
functions to manually get and set the mode of the service
respectively.

** Working alongside the safety mechanisms of =custom.el=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: safety
:END:

=load-theme= is part of the =custom.el= library and it comes with
certain [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html][security features]] that you may regard as inconvenient, but
they're absolutely necessary to preserve the security of your
system. We have decided to work hand in hand with these pre-existing
safety mechanisms in favor of implementing our own.

Loading a theme never before loaded will result in a prompt which you
must answer with a "yes" in order to load the theme; however, that's
not feasible when you're using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Emacs as a Server]].

You should verify that the themes which you have previously specified
in the =darkman-themes= variable have all been loaded at some point in
the past, and you can do this by loading them manually using =M-x
load-theme RET=.

* Configuration

** Enabling themes 

* Debugging

** Is D-Bus running?

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here's an example using =systemd=:

#+begin_src sh
systemctl status dbus
#+end_src

#+begin_example
● dbus.service - D-Bus System Message Bus
     Loaded: loaded
     Active: active (running)
#+end_example

** Is Darkman running?

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here's an example using =systemd=:

#+begin_src sh
systemctl status --user darkman
#+end_src

#+begin_example
● darkman.service - Framework for dark-mode and light-mode transitions.
     Loaded: loaded
     Active: active (running)
#+end_example

** Is Emacs built with D-Bus support?

Usually it is, unless you're building from source, in which case you
can verify whether or not Emacs was built with D-Bus support using
=C-h v system-configuration-features RET= which should list =DBUS=.
